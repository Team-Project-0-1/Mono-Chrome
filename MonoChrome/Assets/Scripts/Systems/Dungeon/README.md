# Dungeon System

Scripts responsible for procedural dungeon generation and navigation are kept here.
`DungeonController` manages dungeon flow and should live inside this folder.

See `CLAUDE.md` for overall architecture and folder placement rules. Debug scripts for the UI are found under `../UI/Debug`.
